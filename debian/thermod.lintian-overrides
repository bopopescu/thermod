# The file var/lib/thermod/timetable.json contains the schedule of the
# thermostat and it is changed by the daemon itself when the user modify
# the timetable through a client. This can happen many times a day, so,
# i.e., a tool like etckeeper cannot track all the changes but makes a
# commit every night. To prevent these unecessary commits I have put
# the file outside /etc folder, marking it a conffile in order to not
# be overwritten automatically upon package upgrade.
